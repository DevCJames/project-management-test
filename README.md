## Stories
A milestone can be used to break down large issues into smaller ones. This gives all the relevant issues a central place, to keeps designs, documents etc.
It also gives the ability to see how far along the feature is.

Milestones can also be used for large groups of issues, for example bugs. this will help everyone visualise where we are at with them.
